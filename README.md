# Markify Pro — Ultimate Bulk Video Watermarker for Creators & Editors

Markify Pro is an advanced, high-fidelity desktop application engineered for high-performance batch video watermarking. Designed specifically for content creators, social media marketing agencies, and professional editors, Markify Pro automatically detects, groups, crops, scales, and overlays watermarks onto both vertical formats (Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts - 9:16) and widescreen formats (Landscape - 16:9) simultaneously. 

Built using Electron, HTML5/CSS3, and localized high-performance FFmpeg/FFprobe binaries, Markify Pro runs 100% locally on your machine, ensuring full data privacy, zero subscription fees, and lightning-fast offline processing.

4.  **Perform Deletion & Clearing Operations**:
    *   Check individual checkboxes in the list to select specific videos, or check the header checkbox to select all.
    *   Click **Delete Selected** to clear only checked videos, or click **Clear All** to clear the entire queue.
5.  **Process and Export**:
    *   To watermark a single video from the queue, click the **Export (Save Icon)** button on its row.
    *   To watermark all videos in the queue in sequence, click **Start Watermarking** at the bottom left.
